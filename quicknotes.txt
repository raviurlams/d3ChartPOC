I would propose splitting it into 2 or 3 phases. Phase 1 being replicate the chart in the PDF. Phase 2 and 3 is to add interactivity and refine the overall chart
How many hours do you think it will take to ship the first version? (That is, similar to the one in the PDF; no interactive/event driven programming yet)

1.Phase 1 being replicate the chart in the PDF

1. Convert Excel data into Javascript Object 
2. Create Y axis
3. Ploting the data points
4. Drawing the normal/curved lines


big task is converting your excel into proper data structure
[11:13:10 PM] J D: also, i should clarify what i meant by reproducing the chart
as long as it's in that style, it's fine
the curves don't have to be exactly the same
even the X-axis placement of each language doesn't have to be the same. All that matters is that it's similar and readable to the human eye
[11:13:32 PM] J D: One thing I'm not clear on is if D3.js can spit out charts based on the JSON data that aren't a tangled mess. How will the code go about making a readable chart with optimized spacing of the arrows, etc? Does that question make sense?  I'm not sure how it optimizes for that

the reason I ask is I anticipate having the JSON data change slightly as I add new languages to it, and change the years etc. Will the D3 be able to update on the spot like this?
[11:13:44 PM] J D: does that make sense?


1. x-axis gap ?
2. arrows stop ? and color. tool tip
3. Label ?
